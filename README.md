# CryptoNightJ
An unoptimised Java native implementation of the CryptoNight proof of work algorithm, see [CryptoNightJNI](https://github.com/jounaidr/CryptoNightJNI) for an optimal solution.

The algorithms implementation can be found in: [Cryptonight.java](https://github.com/jounaidr/CryptoNightJ/blob/main/src/main/java/Cryptonight.java) with various other hashing packages used.
