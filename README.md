# CryptoNightJ
An unoptimised Java native implementation of the CryptoNight proof of work algorithm, see [CryptoNightJNI](https://github.com/jounaidr/CryptoNightJNI) for an optimal solution.

The algorithms implementation can be found in: [Cryptonight.java](https://github.com/jounaidr/CryptoNightJ/blob/main/src/main/java/Cryptonight.java) with various other hashing packages used.

### Dependencies
The project structure and dependencies can be seen in the following diagram:

### TODO
- Optimisation throughout (see code)
- Refactor Cryptonight.java to implement hashing digest interface as to stay consistent with other Java hashing algorithms
